# WTF is CTF

If you don't know what CTF is, then you can read about it [here](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/). Basically, it's hacker competitions where you are given different tasks and the answer to a task is a string called **flag**.

**Writeup** is a description of solution for a specific task.

# General info

Here are mostly my writeups for different CTF tasks. "Mostly" means that other people could took part in the solution as well as me. So, I will try to mention all of them :D

All writeups are about __Reverse Engineering__ and __Binary Exploitation__ tasks. No crypto, forensics, and others. I'm not specialized in such categories. In case you want to explore writeups on other categories, then you can visit [VoidHack writeups page](https://github.com/VoidHack/write-ups) (people say it's a great resource to learn cool hacker stuff)

I sorted all writeups by years and CTF names, so you're welcome to explore them! By the way, I will (at least, I will try to) mirror these writeups to [VoidHack writeups page](https://github.com/VoidHack/write-ups), so you can find them here or there.

# About me

# Contributions

If you find some bug or need an explanation on a weird place in a writeup, then leave an issue and I will try my best to recall what this writeup was about and add some details :D
